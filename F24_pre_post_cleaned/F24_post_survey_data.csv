It is incredibly inefficient at learning material, and it ends up giving bad habits to students who are just entering university (assuming it stays in sta130).  It limits experience and often ends up with people copying their code directly from chatbots without learning the language. It makes it difficult in other classes, knowing that it isnt allowed in those classes, but is encouraged as a learning method here. I do acknowledge the usefulness of chatbots, but forcing them on students is unreasonable, removing marks from their homework if they use it, as well as basing the entirety of the homework and other questions on 'ask chatbot this' or 'ask chatbot that' is not helpful for students who want to learn in a traditional way. However people may answer these questions, I guarantee that most of the people in sta130 only learned the essence of the subject from chatbots, but did not learn any actual coding or useful programming from it, other than the basics of the basics. It can be good for many things, but is almost always directly plagiarism, and should not be forced on the students."

","I wish more time was spent on developing some base fundamental understanding of coding at the beginning of the course. I understand it was intentional for students to have to put the work in themselves to try to learn it, but I feel like the course would of been less intimidating for myself if I had a smoother introduction into the course. As someone without prior coding experience and endless self doubt over my own abilities I think I gave up too early cause I didn't believe I had the capabilities to catch up with everything moving so fast.
