I could give my own reasoning as to why a question is right but I noticed that GPT was just agreeing with my logic as to why the question was right, even if my logic was wrong.

I think chatbot helps in understanding the content, but in order to get good mark I should find more material online. Also most of the time chatbot will give the clear explanation,Â  however it is hard to let chatbot to give you what you exactly want to know. And communicating with chatbot really cost time. So sometimes I will feel mad if chatbot gave me a brief explanation.

In general, I think chatbot do help me in my midterm(though my grade is not high...but maybe I will get a C if chatbot DNE........Love you ChatBotð¥º)

I thought of taking this course by chance, and now that I'm taking it I actually think of either majoring in statistics or specializing in data science after taking this course.

I especially support the fact that STA130 (and hopefully all the other STA courses) encourage the usage of LLMs despite the fact that other courses outright mark them as Academical Offense, desperately trying to postpone the inevitable - the undoubtable efficiency of ChatBots.

Also, I wanted to mention the positive effect of Professor Schwartz's teaching style, namely that students get to know him not only as a professor but also as a person - he's very friendly, encouraging, and listens to phonk - and it makes me want to succeed in the course even more.

One thing that I don't really understand about the course is the grading scheme, and in particular the fact that you can't get a 100% just by doing all the things that are directly related to class such as homework, attendance, and tests. There are also graded mentorship programs and graded course surveys, and it all looks kinda crazy to me, but hey, this class already takes a very non-traditional approach by allowing ChatBots so it makes sense that STA130 is different from other classes in other aspects such as the grading scheme as well.",0.0,4,4,3.0
