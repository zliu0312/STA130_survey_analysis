For instance, a friend of mine is completely new to Python and programming in general.  It's important to note that while the course doesn't primarily focus on coding skills, a mere corequisite in CSC108 may be insufficient. From my perspective, CSC108 should be a prerequisite. This is for two reasons: Firstly, CSC108 serves as an introduction to Python for beginners, whereas STA130 applies Python in solving practical statistical problems and implementing statistical methods for real-world issues. This isn't to undermine the introductory nature of Python in CSC108, but to highlight the differing applications of the language in each course.  Secondly, the paths of the two courses may not align perfectly. For example, while taking CSC108 this term, I noticed that during data wrangling sessions, certain Python techniques such as slicing, variable creation, list handling, and extracting columns from CSV files can introduce specific challenges, including issues with indexing, floating-point numbers, and memory addresses. These topics are integral to STA130 and demonstrate the need for a solid foundation in Python, as provided by CSC108, before tackling more advanced applications in statistics.
