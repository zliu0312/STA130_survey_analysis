Also, the tutorials didn't feel terribly useful as we could just read the notebooks ahead of time to study the information ourselves (this is what I did). It would've been more helpful to see the TA use the information we learned and observe the process of solving a problem, translating the data and visualizations into inferences, and statistical recommendations themselves.

The instructions provided about the different parts of the project were unhelpful as they were very confusing, difficult to find, and contradictory to one another as one part would tell you to do one thing, then another part tell you to do it differently/tell you to do something else and then on Piazza, the instructor would say that you're supposed to do it a different way completely. Furthermore, I don't really feel like I learned that much about statistical concepts, it was essentially just more hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and more graphing practice, which I think could have been taught and practiced on in simpler assignments, such as the weekly homework. As for the analysis aspect, the statistical concepts were not taught correctly in the first place (I expanded upon this in my course evaluation) so I believe that without having a good statistical background prior to coming into the class, the analysis would have been much more difficult. In order to teach it, I think that there should be a greater emphasis on it in tutorials and the tutorial assignments already cover some analysis, so the course project doesn't need it."

It's strange that the theory is mostly taught during the homework and the friday tutorial sessions, which come after the actual coding lecture. I find both the homework and tutorial worksheet to be very well planned out, but the structure of the course to be quite challenging to follow. I think it would make more sense to make the lecture into 1/2 theory 1/2 coding, or make the tutorial session and homework come before the actual coding lecture. Thankfully I am in the afternoon section. After week 6 or so I tried to allocate an hour or two before my afternoon class at 12 to watch the recording of the morning lecture just so that I can try and keep up with Professor Schartz lecture. I remember professor Schwartz mentioning in the beginning of the course that we should try and code alongside with him, but I found that to be quite impossible. Thankfully with the morning session's code posted, I am able to write down key notes next to the morning lecture's codes. Just trying to keep up with the general concept that Professor Schwartz discusses during lecture is already hard enough, if i had to debug errors with my limited python skills during the lecture, it would've been a disaster (that was me in the first few weeks). Without it, I would have had a much harder time following along. Professor Schartz is a wonderful professor. He is very approachable and overall very pleasant to talk with. Extremely nice and helpful to students, but I feel like during lectures he goes through the content too fast. Thankfully, the lectures are recorded, and I often revisit it. Additionally, having the tutorial homework assigned after friday and due on monday morning is quite unfair, as we have no access to office hours, piazza (TA's dont response over the weekend), and help in general. While the tutorial assignments are lower stakes, it still would be nice to have access to help."

In my experience, spanning three years, I find Python to be a versatile and effective tool. However, this view is not universal. For instance, a friend of mine is completely new to Python and programming in general.  It's important to note that while the course doesn't primarily focus on coding skills, a mere corequisite in CSC108 may be insufficient. From my perspective, CSC108 should be a prerequisite. This is for two reasons: Firstly, CSC108 serves as an introduction to Python for beginners, whereas STA130 applies Python in solving practical statistical problems and implementing statistical methods for real-world issues. This isn't to undermine the introductory nature of Python in CSC108, but to highlight the differing applications of the language in each course.  Secondly, the paths of the two courses may not align perfectly. For example, while taking CSC108 this term, I noticed that during data wrangling sessions, certain Python techniques such as slicing, variable creation, list handling, and extracting columns from CSV files can introduce specific challenges, including issues with indexing, floating-point numbers, and memory addresses. These topics are integral to STA130 and demonstrate the need for a solid foundation in Python, as provided by CSC108, before tackling more advanced applications in statistics.
