If you have to rely on LLMs, please use larger models, such as GPT-4-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, or Llama-3.1-405b which is open source.

I love that chatbot. I really like how it tells me if it can't answer a question, and tells me to take whatever answer it generates (using the internet as its source now instead of course material) with a grain of salt. I feel more confident using NotebookLM and I am so. incredibly. grateful. I do not have to search page-by-page through a 600 paged textbook that will never answer my specific question. 

AND ITS FREE!!

 

Please, for the future students of stats, do not get rid of NotebookLM. You guys ate the house down with that. If NotebookLM has one fan it is me. If NotebookLM has no fans I am dead.

ChatGPT was great too, ESPECIALLY for generating/explaining code, but it definitely has its limits in terms of analysis. I usually try to answer conceptual questions on my own using NotebookLM as my source for any questions. So far my strategy has resulted in some bomb homework grades, so I will be keeping it up. ",5.0,"Course material: wiki-textbook,Course material: homework exercises,ChatBots",,,,,,

However, in preparing for the exam, looking at past and using the chatbot to help write my cheat sheet I found that It wasn't that great at solving the exam questions which might have been a little vague as the exam questions relied on knowing specific details and nuances that I only would know from lectures and tutorials. GPT would give the answers but have some flaw in the reasoning. I could give my own reasoning as to why a question is right but I noticed that GPT was just agreeing with my logic as to why the question was right, even if my logic was wrong. Overall I am still happy with the experience, there were definitely cases in which the chatbot helped in writing the cheat sheet and was useful on the exam. At least helping for 2-3 questions is still better than nothing, but I found that just classic reading textbook and watching videos were better.

I think chatbot helps in understanding the content, but in order to get good mark I should find more material online. Also most of the time chatbot will give the clear explanation,  however it is hard to let chatbot to give you what you exactly want to know. And communicating with chatbot really cost time. So sometimes I will feel mad if chatbot gave me a brief explanation.

In general, I think chatbot do help me in my midterm(though my grade is not high...but maybe I will get a C if chatbot DNE........Love you ChatBot🥺)

BTW, I have asked chatbot to explain variance for at least 4 times.

ChatGPT (free tier),,,,,,,wk07,,,,,"I love STA130. I thought of taking this course by chance, and now that I'm taking it I actually think of either majoring in statistics or specializing in data science after taking this course.

I especially support the fact that STA130 (and hopefully all the other STA courses) encourage the usage of LLMs despite the fact that other courses outright mark them as Academical Offense, desperately trying to postpone the inevitable - the undoubtable efficiency of ChatBots.

Also, I wanted to mention the positive effect of Professor Schwartz's teaching style, namely that students get to know him not only as a professor but also as a person - he's very friendly, encouraging, and listens to phonk - and it makes me want to succeed in the course even more.

One thing that I don't really understand about the course is the grading scheme, and in particular the fact that you can't get a 100% just by doing all the things that are directly related to class such as homework, attendance, and tests. There are also graded mentorship programs and graded course surveys, and it all looks kinda crazy to me, but hey, this class already takes a very non-traditional approach by allowing ChatBots so it makes sense that STA130 is different from other classes in other aspects such as the grading scheme as well.",,,"Coding,Understanding code,Learning to code,Explaining/Learning statistical concepts,Preparing for exams (such our midterm exam),Doing well on exams (specifically our midterm exam),Doing well in the course,Helping with writing,Reading and writing communication practice",I have not used the STA130NBLMbot,"""Vanilla"" ChatBots like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot,STA130 Custom NotebookLM",Yes,"I'm happy to be learning and building the python-oriented skills we're focussed on,I'm building proficiency in using ChatBots to support efficiency and productivity\, and I appreciate the opportunity to do so,I'm building proficiency in using ChatBots to support learning and understanding\, and I appreciate the opportunity to do so,I have a higher opinion of ChatBots than I previously did because of STA130",Minimally
