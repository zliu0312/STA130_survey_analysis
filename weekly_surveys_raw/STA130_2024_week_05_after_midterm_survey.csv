I feel more confident using NotebookLM and I am so. incredibly. grateful. I do not have to search page-by-page through a 600 paged textbook that will never answer my specific question.¬†

AND ITS FREE!!

Please, for the future students of stats, do not get rid of NotebookLM. You guys ate the house down with that. If NotebookLM has one fan it is me. If NotebookLM has no fans I am dead.

ChatGPT was great too, ESPECIALLY for generating/explaining code, but it definitely has its limits in terms of analysis. I usually try to answer conceptual questions on my own using NotebookLM as my source for any questions. So far my strategy has resulted in some bomb homework grades, so I will be keeping it up.¬†",0.0,2,4,0.75
