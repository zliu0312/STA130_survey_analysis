LLMs prefer continuity of text over factual correctness and would make up information when the model doesn't hold it, just to keep the text flow.

If you have to rely on LLMs, please use larger models, such as GPT-4-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, or Llama-3.1-405b which is open source.

And, at least, do not interrogate an LLM when it refuse to give you information, because when it says it doesn't know, it really doesn't know. Interrogation will just yield hallucinations.",0.0,5,2,3.0
